# inputrc

Although I am making more of an effort to use the built-in (emacs)
auto-completions, it is possible to make every program (that uses readline, 
anyway) use Vim bindings instead. In `~/.inputrc`:

    # Thanks: http://acg.github.com/2011/05/17/put-everything-in-vi-mode.html
    set keymap vi
    set editing-mode vi

The only reason I switched away is the escape key is kind of far away on my
work keyboard (and I don't know if you can remap it), and I couldn't figure out
how to get into the GUI mode in GDB (C-x o).
